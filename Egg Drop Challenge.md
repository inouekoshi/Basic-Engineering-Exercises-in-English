## Why couldn't we use all the drawing paper?
I was trying to make an object that would protect an egg using a honeycomb structure. I was cutting some drawing paper in class to make a little progress in the production because we were short on time, and the teacher found me and **crushed part of the honeycomb**.I then made a major design change and proceeded with production using the remaining construction paper.

## Description of production
This object has large wings to take advantage of aerodynamic drag. This is called the **roof**. It also has a **basket** to hold the eggs suspended from the roof and **legs** to prevent direct damage to the eggs when they land.
