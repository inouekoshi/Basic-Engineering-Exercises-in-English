# Description of the object I created
## 4I09 InoueKoshi


## summary
- title：**Challenger ship**
- Production time：**Less than 1 hour**
- Number of Tests：**３ times**
- Amount of drawing paper used：**80% of drawing paper**


## Why couldn't we use all the drawing paper?
I was trying to make an object that would protect an egg using a honeycomb structure. I was cutting some drawing paper in class to make a little progress in the production because we were short on time, and the teacher found me and **crushed part of the honeycomb**.I then made a major design change and proceeded with production using the remaining construction paper.


## Description of production
This object has large wings to take advantage of aerodynamic drag. This is called the **roof**. It also has a **basket** to hold the eggs suspended from the roof and **legs** to prevent direct damage to the eggs when they land.
### About the Roof
- abc
- def
### About the basket
- To avoid wasting drawing paper, one sheet of drawing paper was made to follow. 
- The eggs were made a little larger so that they would be easier to put in on the day of the test.
### About the legs
- I created the egg in the hope that landing on four legs, like Apollo 11, would absorb the shock and protect the egg.
- It also plays a role in hanging baskets (to save drawing paper).
